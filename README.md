# Kotlin Car Track

Kotlin Car Track is a simple app not meant for consumers. The primary goals of this app were to reinforce recently learned Kotlin skills and refresh Android App Development.

* Kotlin Car Track allows a user to select the year, make, and model of a car to add it to a list at the bottom of the screen
* Car data is from the [NHTSA Vehicle API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/)
* OkHTTP 3 library was implemented for performing the API calls

This app was developed using Kotlin and Android Studio. It targets Android SDK Version 29 (Q).
